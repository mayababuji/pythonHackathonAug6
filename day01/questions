2.How can you add and remove elements from a list?  fruits = ['apple', 'banana']
3.  Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a list. numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
4.How do you check if an element exists in a list? colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'] check if green is in colors
5. Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with only the even.
6. What will be the output of the following?
  x = "5"
  y = 3
  print(x * y)
7. a = [1, 2]  b = [1, 2] what will be a ==b and a is b output?
8. Write a function that takes a string and returns a dictionary with each character as a key and its frequency as the value.
    Example 
      Input: "banana"
      Output: {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}
9.Given a list of words, return a dictionary where the key is the word length, and the value is a list of words of that length.
